# Procedural Tiled Map Generator
A simple procedural tiled terrain-like texture generator.

It's directly adapted from a small project I made several years ago.
Only bugfixes and visual enhancements were applied, so the core code is still quite unoptimized. Feel free to peruse!

TODO (in my spare time, perchance, one day maybe?):
- Add option to download map (very easy, quick)
- Complete the half-implemented water/land proportions control (easy, somewhat long)
- Add sand texture (easy, long)
- Add navigation controls and 3D rotation (medium, long?)
- Add flora, buildings, etc. on top of the generated tiles (ambitious, Peter Molyneux)
- Optimize the code (nightmare, an eternity of sufferance)
