A simple procedural tiled terrain-like texture generator.

It's directly adapted from a small project I made several years ago.
Only bugfixes and visual enhancements were applied, so the core code is still quite unoptimized. Feel free to peruse!

## Features
- Generate square tiled maps with randomized matching terrain textures
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Adjust a few display options

### TODO (in my spare time, perchance, one day maybe?):
- Add option to download map (very easy, quick)
- Complete the half-implemented water/land proportions control (easy, somewhat long)
- Add sand texture (easy, long)
- Add navigation controls and 3D rotation (medium, long?)
- Add flora, buildings, etc. on top of the generated tiles (ambitious, Peter Molyneux)
- Optimize the code (nightmare, an eternity of sufferance)
=======
- Adjust a few display options
>>>>>>> unstable
